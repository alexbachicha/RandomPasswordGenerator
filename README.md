## Random Password Generator

The goal of this project was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.

The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript. The interface is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Critera for password generation includes:
  1. Length of password (amount of characters)
  2. The use of numbers
  3. The use of special characters 
  4. The use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or both
